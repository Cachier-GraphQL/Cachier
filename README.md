# Cache-MoneyQL

Welcome to Cache-MoneyQL, a lightweight GraphQL caching tool that is configured specifically for GraphQL to reduce load times and minimize data fetching.  

GraphQL does not have native HTTP caching as a result of its singular employment of the POST method, forcing the danger of over-fetching by re-running queries and bogging down load times. 

Our algorithm uses a customized Least Recently Used (LRU) Smallest Latency First Replacement(SLFR) eviction policy.



## Getting Started
First, install the Redis package for Node.js

`npm install redis`

Then install our npm package.
